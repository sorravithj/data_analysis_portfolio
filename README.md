### Sales Analysis and Hierarchy Extraction using SQL  
**Code:** SQL: [`sales-data-extract.sql`](https://github.com/sorravithj/data_analysis_portfolio/blob/main/sales-data-from-ms-server.sql)  
  
**Description:** This project focuses on extracting and analyzing sales data from a database table. Through SQL queries, I extract sales information, including product codes and their hierarchical relationships (group to subclass), as well as store formats and their corresponding statuses. The analysis aims to provide insights into sales performance, product categorization, and store status evaluation.

**Dataset:** The dataset used in this project is a sales table within the database. It contains information such as transaction details, product codes, sales amounts, and store format statuses. The dataset encompasses sales data from multiple stores and covers a specific time period.

**Skills:** SQL coding (SQL Server), including SELECT, JOIN, FILTER, GROUP BY, hierarchical data modeling  

**Software:** DBeaver  

**Results:** 
Based on the analysis, the following conclusions and recommendations were made:
1. Identified top-selling products/categories for targeted marketing.
2. Improved categorization and decision-making using product hierarchies.
3. Evaluated store format statuses to identify underperforming stores.

### Talent Acquisition Dashboard
**Dashboard:** Looker Studio: [`recruitment-dashboard.pdf`](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nY0Adlebnb3hDmNJ99yccywwTrnYgUkO/view?usp=sharing)  
**Technology:** Looker Studio, Google Sheets, R Studio, Web API  
  
**Description:**  

This dashboard contains datasets of talent acquisition team from a small start-up company with employees around 500 across 5 countries in Asia showing the detail of company's manpower movement thorughout a year. 

The data includes the number of positions available and closed, successful and rejection rate of candidates.  
  
**Data Source:**

Primary sources of this daahboard came from google spreadsheet software  connected to the dashboard. The data were pulled using API provided by the systems (HRIS) and R scriptâ€™s googlesheets4 package from tidyverse. 

**Data Flow Diagram:** HRIS systems > Web API and R script > Google Sheets > Looker Studio  

**Data Manipulation:**  

Data manipulation process happened two places which were inside the google sheets and inside the google looker studio itself.

Inside Google sheets the data manipulation included fixing incorrect, incomplete, duplicate, or otherwise erroneous data using spreadsheet function such as index, match, vlookup, if(s), iferror, right, left, sum, avg, count etc.

Inside the Looker Studio includes using functions and operators to create calculated fields (e.g., SUM, AVG, COUNT, CASE WHEN, IF), data blending for joining multiple tables together. 

**Findings:**

1.	The company manpower had one big problem which were people keep resigning and the talent team kept filling the same positions which were shown on replacement and addition stacked bar chart. 
2.	The month after the bonus payout (April), there were significant increase in time-to-fill per position because a lot of employees including talent team resigned this month. This was called the crisis month.  
3.	Only around 65 percent of available positions can be filled.  
4.	Tech and client facing-related positions were the most that left and hard to replace. 

**Implication:**
The findings led the company to conduct current employees survey and exit feedback. The roots of the problem came from pay rate and direct managers for the tech department but from client if the client-facing positions. This helped the company to solve the problem with the right solution afterwards.  

### Promotion Campaign Dashboard
**Dashboard:** Power BI: [`promotion-dashboard.pdf`](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yikUz0orXr0qKbyGw0u0-BKJsmL1PHEL/view?usp=sharing)  
**Technology:** Power BI, MS SQL, R Studio, DAX, Power Query  

**Description:**  
This BI dashboard contains more than 10 million rows of sales from a retail business including date, store format, campaign name, campaign week to head of each product category. 

The purpose of this dashboard is to track top 5 most important measures which are Sales, GP, Compensation, Discount, and Other Incomes which will help company decide which products should and shouldnâ€™t run the promotion and what the promotion should be run at a given store.  
 
**Data Source:** MS SQL Server   

**Data Flow Diagram:**  

1. SQL Server > Power BI  
2. SQL Server > R > Parquet file > Power BI   

**Data Manipulation:**  

Data Manipulation and Data Cleansing happened two places which were SQL Server and Power Query and DAX inside the Power BI. 

Inside the SQL Server the data manipulation included extracting part of string, joining multiple tables and aggregation using functions such as MONTH, YEAR, RIGHT, LEFT, LEFT JOIN, SUM etc. 

Inside the Power Query and DAX the data manipulation included conditial column, pivot, unpivot, append queries, create relationship, and aggregation using functions such as Table.AddColumn, each if, Table.Unpivot, Table.Combine, RELATE, CALCULATE, SUM, SUMX, DIVIDE 

**Findings:** 

1.	While in 2022 the store sold more products in normal price than 2021 but no significant increase of GP. GP from normal price without promotion also dropped a little bit when compared to 2021. 
2.	Some product categories such as coffee or club generate more sales when they were on promotion. Hence most of the GP came from sales during promotion period. These are the product that have high cost to make.  
3.	InStore sales promotion campaign is the campaign that generate GP per sales back to the company the most. 

**Implication:**  

1.	To increase GP, the company should not lower or run the promotion on the products such as perishable or food because these are the products that customers are buying whether they had the promotion or not.  
2.	On other hands to boost GP in some product categories such as coffee and club which now gave lower GP, we need to run the promotion campaign such as InStore sales which will help the company sales more product quantity and gave rise to the GP until the customers are willing to buy the product full price and %GP will then increase.  

### Employee Exit Analysis  
**Presentation:** [`employee-exit.pdf`](https://github.com/sorravithj/data_analysis_portfolio/blob/main/exit-analysis-presentation.pdf)  
  
**Description:** A company faced persistent disruption due to high employee turnover and decided to investigate the underlying causes. Using a simulated dataset with 778 records, the project analyzed employee data including status, tenure, gender, salary, and exit feedback. R and RStudio were utilized for tasks such as data loading, cleansing, outlier removal, descriptive statistics, data visualization, and deriving insights.    
**Skills:** R coding, data exploration, data cleansing, descriptive statistics, data visualisation, and business knowledge    
**Technology:** R Studio, ggplot2, dplyr, readr, lubridate, and janitor   
**Results:** this project uncovered the underlying causes of employee turnover, enabling the company to make informed decisions and implement effective measures to reduce turnover and improve overall employee satisfaction and retention.
